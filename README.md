## Build Instructions

### Dependencies

* [Gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (XCode make works, too)
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandoc 2.7.3+](https://pandoc.org/)
* XeLaTeX (can be found in [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/))
* [Liberation fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts) (sans, serif, mono)

Mac dependencies install (reopen terminal after doing this):

```
xcode-select --install                  # installs make
brew install python                     # installs Python3
brew install pandoc
brew install mactex                     # installs XeLaTeX
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install font-liberation            # installs Liberation fonts
```

You might have to add something like this to your path to find `xelatex`:

```
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/universal-darwin
```

### Build

1. Type `make` from the top-level directory.

   If you have Gnu Make, it should work fine.  Other makes might work as
   well.  Windows users might want to check out Cygwin.

2. Type `make stage` to copy all the build products and website to the
   `stage` directory.

3. There is no step three.

You can also `cd` to the `src` directory and `make`.

`make clean` cleans, and `make pristine` cleans to "original" state.

To embed your own fonts in the PDFs, see the `src/Makefile` for examples.

The `upload` target in the root `Makefile` demonstrates the build steps
for a complete release.  You'll need to change the `UPLOADDIR` macro in
the top-level `Makefile` to point to your host if you want to use that.
You're free to upload whatever versions you desire individually, as
well.

## Pull Requests

Please keep these on the scale of typo and bug fixes. That way I don't
have to consider any copyright issues when merging changes.

## TODO

* Copy code out
* Exercises
* Index
* C23
