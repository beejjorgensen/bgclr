    <h1>Why Beej's Guide to C doesn't use Bing (or DuckDuckGo)</h1>

    <p>First: an apology for being clickbaity. I love DuckDuckGo. I want
    to use DDG to search <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgc/">Beej's
    Guide to C</a>. This really isn't their fault. It's Microsoft's.

    <p>See, DDG relies on Bing, and Bing won't index this site for
    some reason.

    <p>So DDG is <a
    href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fbeej.us%2Fguide%2Fbgc%2F&ia=web">blind
    to this content</a>. And <a
    href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fbeej.us%2Fguide%2Fbgc&form=QBLH&sp=-1&pq=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fbeej.us%2Fguide%2Fbg&sc=0-29&qs=n&sk=">so
    is Bing</a>.

    <p>Here's Google's search of the C guide (try searching for "<tt>acos</tt>"):

    <script async src="https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=ae3393718e443f40f">
    </script>
    <div class="gcse-search"></div>

    And here's DDG's:

    <p><form method="get" id="ddgSearch" action="https://duckduckgo.com/">
        <input type="hidden" name="sites" value="https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="k7" value="#ffffff"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="k8" value="#222222"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="k9" value="#00278e"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="kx" value="#20692b"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="kj" value="#fafafa"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="kt" value="p"/>
        <table style="margin:0 1em">
        <tr>
        <td style="width:100%">
        <input style="width:calc(100% - 1em)" type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search Beej's Guide to C..." aria-label="Search Beej's Guide to C on DuckDuckGo"/>
        </td>
        <td>
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
        </td>
        </table>
    </form>

    <p>(I know I can turn off the Google logo in the search, but I've
    left it in there just to rub salt in Microsoft's wound.)

    <p>I've added a sitemap (which wasn't required), I'm not trying to
    do any SEO scamming, and I've done all kinds of stuff through
    Microsoft's webmaster tools to try to fix it, but it always reports:

    <blockquote>
    The inspected URL is known to Bing but has some issues which are
    preventing indexation. We recommend you to follow <a
    href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmasters-guidelines-30fba23a">Bing
    Webmaster Guidelines</a> to increase your chances of indexation.
    </blockquote>

    <p>It's worth noting that Bing has no trouble with any of my other
    guides.

    <p>The only thing I can see in Microsoft's documentation that I
    might be in violation of is their prohibition on sites that are
    too similar. The landing page for this guide is, indeed, very
    similar to that of the other guides, but the similarity stops
    there; the content is completely different. I'm not going to
    start throwing in random keyboard cat GIFs just to make the
    landing page different enough to fool Microsoft's filter, if that
    even is the problem.

    <p>Running MS's diagnostic let me know that I was missing the
    <tt>lang</tt> attribute in my <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> tag, but that
    was it. (I've added it, but if Bing restricted sites based on that,
    99% of the web would remain unindexed.)

    <p>So I contacted them in a last-chance <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass">Hail Mary</a>.

    <p>They said they'd get back within <b>10</b> days. (They put the
    "10" in bold in their reply to my submission.)

    <p>And just <b>18</b> days later, I got a reply:

    <blockquote>
    <p>Thank you for your patience!

    <p>After further review, it appears that your site
    https://beej.us/guide/bgc/ did not meet the standards set by
    Bing the last time it was crawled.

    <p>Bing constantly prioritizes the content to be indexed that
    will drive highest users satisfaction. Please review our Bing
    Webmaster Guidelines, to better understand criteria for most
    valuable content.

    </blockquote>

    <p>Maybe it's just not "valuable content". If me spending years
    writing a book on C and giving it away for free with no ads isn't
    valuable content to Bing, it just goes to show how much they hate
    the language. ðŸ˜œ

    <p>But if they're not indexing this, you have to wonder what other
    content they aren't giving you.

    <p>Fix your broken algorithm, Microsoft. That way I can stop
    advertising your best friend, Google. Wouldn't that make you
    happy?<span class="slug"></span>
