Let your journey into hugeness teach us all a lesson. Absolute power is
a sticky wicket. And, Arthur, chum, you were the stickiest. Don't you
get it, good friend? Some of the best things come in small packages. But
large things can't. Unless they're inflatable, or require some assembly,
or unless they're hearts. Yes, giant, juicy, loving hearts. As big as
the moon, but much, much warmer.
